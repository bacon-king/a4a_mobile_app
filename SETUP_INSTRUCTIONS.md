2. Add case in `lib/screens/app_screen.dart`
3. Update navigation in `lib/providers/app_state_provider.dart`

### Modifying Themes
- Edit `lib/providers/theme_provider.dart`
- Customize colors, fonts, and component styles
- Add new theme modes as needed

### Adding Form Validation
- Use `form_field_validator` package (already included)
- Add validation rules in form fields
- Display error messages appropriately

## Testing

### Run in Debug Mode
```bash
flutter run --debug
```

### Run in Release Mode
```bash
flutter run --release
```

### Build APK
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### Build iOS (macOS only)
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dependencies not found**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Build errors**:
   - Check Flutter SDK version: `flutter --version`
   - Update dependencies: `flutter pub upgrade`

3. **Emulator issues**:
   - Start Android emulator: `flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>`
   - List available emulators: `flutter emulators`

4. **iOS build issues** (macOS only):
